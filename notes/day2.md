## üéØ Goal

Today I decided to start going through the Exercism Ruby track to:

* Reinforce my understanding of Ruby basics
* Get used to Ruby syntax and idioms
---

## ‚úÖ Completed Exercises

### 1. `hello-world`

* Verified basic test setup with `assert_equal`

### 2. `lasagna`

* Simple math methods, constants, and return values

### 3. `two-fer`

* Practiced basic conditionals and string interpolation
* First time writing methods that return values based on input

### 4. `savings-account`

* Implemented logic using conditionals and floats
* Created helper methods like `interest_rate`, `annual_balance_update`, and `years_before_desired_balance`
* Reinforced `if`, return statements, float math

### 5. `port-palermo`

* Got to use Ruby `Symbol`s for constants (e.g. `:PALE`)
* Implemented simple rules with control flow and symbol return

### 6. `log-line-parser`

* Used `split`, `strip`, and `downcase` for string normalization

### 7. `assembly-line`

* Applied formulaic logic, float multiplication, basic conditions

### 8. `reverse-string`

* Reversed a string using built-in methods

### 9. `isogram`

* Checked for uniqueness using hashes and conditionals

### 10. `acronym`

* Used regex and string methods to extract capital letters from words

### 11. `amusement-park`

* Implemented instance methods using instance variables
* Reinforced class definition, attribute access, and simple logic

### 12. `amusement-park-improvements`

* Continued extending the AmusementPark::Attendee class
* Practiced code reuse, method chaining, and clean interfaces

## üîç Observations

* I‚Äôm getting more confident reading and writing Ruby methods
* Pattern matching and symbol use in return values is elegant
* Test-driven style of Exercism helps with writing clean interfaces
* Ruby‚Äôs string methods are incredibly expressive and concise
