# ðŸ”„ Day 11 â€“ Refactoring Learning Focus & Introduction to GoRails

**Date:** 6 June 2025

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Continue daily Exercism practice, while expanding Rails framework knowledge and starting GoRails as the main learning resource.

---

## âœ… What I did

### 1. Exercism Practice

- ðŸ”„ **In Progress: Bowling**
  - Attempted to solve the complex scoring algorithm for bowling
  - Couldnâ€™t pass the tests yet, so postponed the task
  - Identified the need for deeper understanding of complex conditional logic and game state transitions

- âœ… **Completed:**
  - `boutique-inventory-improvements` â€“ first encounter with `obstruct`
    - A pattern common in JavaScript, now seen applied in Ruby
  - `raindrops` â€“ converting numbers to strings based on rules
  - `basic_song_loader` â€“ reading song lyrics from a file (`song.txt`)

- ðŸ§  Additional learning:
  - Learned the `.first` method and other Ruby core utilities
  - Starting to grasp the idiomatic Ruby style

---

### 2. New Direction: GoRails

- ðŸ§­ **Discovered:** [GoRails.com](https://gorails.com/)
  - Modern and professionally structured platform focused on Ruby on Rails
  - Offers tutorials, screencasts, deployment guides, API integration, background jobs, Hotwire, and more

- ðŸ›‘ **Decision:** Temporarily pause Exercism tasks
  - Reason: Exercism focuses only on Ruby, but I want to study Rails as a whole (Ruby + framework + toolchain)
  - GoRails allows me to connect theory with practical real-world application development

---

## ðŸ’¡ What I learned

- **Don't get stuck:** If a problem is frustrating or inefficient, itâ€™s better to move on and return later with a fresh mind
- **Rails â‰  Ruby:** Rails has its own specifics; a good learning path must include the language and the framework together
- **GoRails as primary source:** Structured content, practical use-cases, and a professional learning path

---

## ðŸ”­ Next Steps

- **Tomorrow:** Start first GoRails course (likely model/controller/topic as recommended)
- **Bowling:** Return to the challenge later with a fresh perspective
- **Rails Deep Dive:** Dedicate time to understanding MVC, testing, and Rails best practices
- **Mini CRM Refactor:** Consider rewriting Mini CRM or starting a new project in the GoRails style
