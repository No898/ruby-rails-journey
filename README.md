# ðŸ›¤ Ruby & Rails Journey

This repository documents my personal learning journey with **Ruby** and **Ruby on Rails**.  
My goal is to gain a solid understanding of both the language and the framework â€” through small projects, real exercises, and gradual, consistent practice.

I treat this as a **public playground**, portfolio piece, and study log â€” everything I learn is tracked here.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

### ðŸ§  Ruby (The Language)

#### âœ… 1. Fundamentals
- [X] Data types: `Integer`, `Float`, `String`, `Symbol`, `Boolean`, `NilClass`
- [X] Variables: local, global, instance (`@`), class (`@@`)
- [X] Conditionals: `if`, `elsif`, `else`, `unless`, ternary operator
- [X] Loops: `while`, `until`, `for`, `loop`, `each`
- [X] Methods: definition, parameters, return values
- [X] Blocks: `do..end`, `{}` syntax
- [X] Arrays and Hashes: CRUD, iteration
- [X] String manipulation: `split`, `gsub`, `interpolation`, `upcase`, etc.
- [ ] File handling: `File.read`, `File.write`, working with `JSON` and `CSV`
- [ ] Exception handling: `begin`, `rescue`, `ensure`
- [ ] `require`, `load`, working with gems

#### ðŸ§± 2. OOP & Idiomatic Ruby
- [ ] Classes and objects, constructors (`initialize`), `self`
- [ ] `attr_accessor`, `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`
- [ ] Inheritance (`<`) and calling `super`
- [ ] Modules: `module`, `include`, `extend`
- [ ] Method introspection: `respond_to?`, `send`, `method_missing`
- [ ] `yield`, `block_given?`, `Proc`, `lambda`, closures
- [ ] Enumerable module: `map`, `select`, `reject`, `reduce`, etc.
- [ ] Symbols vs Strings â€” performance and semantics
- [ ] Time and Date classes: `Time.now`, `Date.today`
- [ ] Regular expressions: `/pattern/`, `match?`, `scan`, `gsub`
- [ ] Standard library: `OpenStruct`, `Struct`, `Set`, etc.

#### ðŸ§ª 3. Practical Extras
- [ ] Gemfile & Bundler: `bundle init`, `bundle install`, `bundle exec`
- [ ] Debugging: `puts`, `p`, `irb`, `pry`, `byebug`
- [ ] Testing: `Minitest` basics (optionally `RSpec`)
- [ ] CLI scripting: `ARGV`, `OptionParser`
- [ ] Using environment variables: `ENV['SOME_KEY']`
- [ ] Documentation tools: `ri`, `yard`, [rubydoc.info](https://rubydoc.info)
- [ ] (Optional) Writing your own gem

### ðŸš‚ Ruby on Rails (The Framework)
- [ ] Project structure and Rails conventions
- [ ] MVC architecture (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller)
- [ ] Generators and scaffolding
- [ ] Routing and RESTful resources
- [ ] CRUD with Active Record
- [ ] Model validations and constraints
- [ ] Working with forms (`form_with`, strong params)
- [ ] Custom views, layouts, and partials
- [ ] Flash messages and sessions
- [ ] Manual user authentication (no Devise)
- [ ] Nested resources and associations (`has_many`, `belongs_to`)
- [ ] Database migrations and schema design
- [ ] Testing basics (Minitest or RSpec)
- [ ] Environment configs and secrets
- [ ] Git project structure and .gitignore best practices
- [ ] (Optional) Deployment to Render / Fly.io / Railway

## ðŸ›  Projects in This Repo

### `/ruby-cli`
Small Ruby command-line projects built to practice the language.

### `/exercism/ruby`
All Ruby track exercises from Exercism, solved sequentially with test coverage and progressive difficulty.

### `/rails`
Rails applications using MVC structure, built during exploration.

### `/notes`
Topic-based notes and study logs, organized by day (`day1.md`, `day2.md`, ...).
