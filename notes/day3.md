# ✅ Day 3 – Mini Project & Word Count

**Date:** 29 May 2025

---

## 🎯 Goal

Today I wanted to take a short break from pure exercises and build something small using more common Ruby elements like file handling, arrays, hashes, and conditionals.

---

## ✅ What I did

### 1. `ruby-todo`

* Built a command-line To-Do app using Ruby
* Implemented commands: `add`, `list`, `done`, `remove`, `clear`, `exit`
* Used `File.read` / `File.write` with JSON for persistent storage
* Practiced class design with `Task`, terminal I/O, and menu logic
* Bonus: added colors and formatting to improve UX

### 2. `exe.rb` (CLI helper script)

* Created a helper script to run Exercism tests and submissions faster
* Added interactive folder/file selection using basic Ruby I/O
* Much faster than typing full paths every time

### 3. `word-count` (Exercism)

* Implemented the `Phrase` class and `word_count` method
* Used regular expressions to tokenize text correctly
* Learned how to handle contractions, punctuation, and word boundaries
* Passed all Exercism tests

## 🔍 Observations

* Regex is incredibly powerful in Ruby when paired with string methods
* I’m now comfortable creating small scripts from scratch
* File I/O and Hash logic are intuitive and readable in Ruby
* Mixing structured Exercism problems with creative tasks helps me retain the syntax better
